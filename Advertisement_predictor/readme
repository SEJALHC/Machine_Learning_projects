# 📊 Advertising Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts **Sales** based on advertising expenses across **TV, Radio, and Newspaper** channels.  
The model used is **Multiple Linear Regression**, a fundamental Machine Learning algorithm for continuous value prediction.

---

## 🧠 Project Goal

To understand how different advertising channels affect product sales, and to evaluate how well Linear Regression can model the relationship.

## 📁 Dataset Information

The dataset (`Advertising.csv`) contains:

| Feature       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| TV            | Advertising budget spent on TV (in thousands) |
| Radio         | Advertising budget spent on Radio (in thousands) |
| Newspaper     | Advertising budget spent on Newspaper (in thousands) |
| Sales         | Units sold (target variable) |

**Note:** The dataset may include column `Unnamed: 0`, which is removed during preprocessing.
